        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Elizabeth!</h2>
        <p>
            I am a CyberSecurity student at UNCC. The Bootcamp is a really intensive training experience, but the
                instructors and TAs are the best!
            <br><br>
            Following this class, I will be seeking certification and work in the security field. Pleased to meet you!

                <h3>Two Simple Security Hacks for Everyone</h3>
                <h4>secure site, phishing</h4>
                <p>Most of us do not check the news to find out who was recently hacked, or which company was hit with malware. 
                   However, most people do use the internet. Whenever you are on a website, there is a little lock icon next to the site url. 
                   If that lock is closed, it is meant to indicate that it is a secure site. 
                   Check out this site for more info: <a href="https://it.wisc.edu/news/two-things-to-look-for-in-a-secure-website/">Secure Site</a><br>

                   Look at the icon next time you try out a new website and see if the lock is closed. If there is no lock, close your browser!<br>

                   Have you gotten an email from someone or a company that you do not know? Is the spelling a little off? Click or tap on the sender’s email address.
                   A good hacker can copy an address name, but when you click on the highlighted “name” it will show the actual address. 
                   If it does not match the supposed sender, or looks fishy, you may have been sent a phishing email.
                   For more details, check out this article: <a href= "https://www.securitymetrics.com/blog/7-ways-recognize-phishing-email">Phishing.</a><br>

                   Even if the subject line tells you that you have won $100, NEVER click on a link inside a phishing email. 
                   Malware could be loaded, or your computer or phone could be hacked. 
                   If you really need $100, work and earn it. It will be definitely yours, and you will not have to worry about where it came from or what hooks might come with it!

                <h3>A Top Security Concern for Corporations</h3>
                <h4>Social Engineering</h4>
                <p>
                    What do you think the greatest security concern is for a top rated company? Data server firewall protection level? 
                    Keeping up with the latest software patches? Encryption and multi-level authentication? How about personnel?<br>
                    
                    Have you ever considered that the most vulnerable aspect of a company is its people? 
                    There are hundreds of reports of data breaches that were caused by angry workers who could still log in to the system, fired or not. 
                    They vented their frustration by damaging the company they held responsible for some sort of negative in their life. 
                    Check out this post for an example: <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/it-admin-admits-sabotaging-ex-employers-network/">Company Sabotaged.</a><br>

                    There are hundreds of other reports, however, of hackers simply asking the right questions at the right time to trick an employee into giving out information. 
                    Two-factor authentication requires a person to respond to a text or email to confirm they are actually trying to log in. 
                    One example is the recent hacking attack on Rockstar, the creators of Grand Theft Auto video games. 
                    Using stolen credentials in the middle of the night, a malicious actor caused a tired employee to authenticate his login. 
                    Of course the employee was not the one logging in, but at that hour the mind does not think clearly. 
                    Check out this blog for details: <a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/being-annoying-as-a-social-engineering-approach">Social Engineering.</a><br>

                    Any of us can be taken advantage of if the right circumstances are arranged. 
                    Keep your information private, and be careful what you authenticate in the middle of the night!
